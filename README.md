## Hangman

A simple terminal Hangman game is included as `hangman.py`.

Usage:

- Run interactively:

```bash
python3 hangman.py
```

- Run a non-interactive demo to see example output:

```bash
python3 hangman.py --demo
```

The game shows the mystery word with correctly guessed letters placed in their slots, and displays letters you've already guessed (both correct and wrong).
